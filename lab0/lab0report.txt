About the M4C123GH6PM Microcontroller:
1. 
a) Section 2.3.3 describes the M4's memory map
b) Table 2-2 gives the memory map of the M4's processor

2.
GPIO_A has base memory address 0x4000.4000

3.
a) Section 10.4 describes the GPIO register map
b) Table 10-6 gives the GPIO register map

4.
Register 2 corresponds to the direction of GPIO ports. 
It's memory offset is 0x400, so for GPIO port A's direction register the memory address is 0x4000.4400.

5.
a) Binary value of 1 corresponds to output.
b) 7:0 = 1001 0001
c) 7:0 = 0x6E

6.
Timer 2 is located at memory address 0x4003.2000.

7.
Register 26 (GPTMTBPV) is located at offset 0x068. This register shows the current free running value of the Timer B prescaler.

8.
Pins in group 3,12,27,39,55 and 25,56 and 2,11,26,42,54 and 34,35 are wired together.

Introduction to the MDO3014 Mixed Domain Oscilloscope:
1. Potential uses of a logic analyzer:
	- Debugging a microprocessor
	- Monitor digital circuits
	- View logic states

2.
a) Push the `trigger menu` button -> select Type:`edge`, and slope:`falling`.
b) Push the `trigger menu` button -> select Type:`edge`, and slope:`rising`.

3.
Adjust the sample rate by turning the horizontal scale knob.

Using the Analog Comparator of the TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller:
2.
Comparator (Vin) -> PC4
Light -> PF1

3.
The ACREFCTL register stores internal reference information.

4.
The ACREFCTL register has a VREF value stored as an 8 bit value, and single bits RNG and EN.

5.
RNG = 1;
VREF = 0x07;
The light will be on between .971 and 1.118 V (.971, 1.118).
